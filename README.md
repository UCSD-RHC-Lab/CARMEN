# Thank you for your interest in CARMEN! The code is coming soon.

CARMEN (Cognitively Assistive Robot for Motivation and Neurorehabilitation) is an open-source social robot system which enables rapid implementation of robot behavior.

We are currently working on polishing code for release. If you would like to be notified when CARMEN is available, please fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUTrslWUZsv2HEugMYTxyTq_xn2nkCZ-EZ3nRFGECNwxc4nA/viewform).
